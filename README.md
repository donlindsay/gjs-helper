gjs-mode.el
===========

I like the idea of using Gnome's GJS javascript shell for coding. js2-mode and js-comint provide a solid foundation for using GJS with Emacs. This is my first try at an Emacs mode, so anyone interested in contributing ideas or code, please feel free to use Github's facilities for doing so. My main concept is to lift the better ideas out of js-comint.el.
